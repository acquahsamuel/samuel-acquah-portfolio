# Angular CLI and Basic Commands

If youâ€™re building applications with Angular, the **Angular CLI (Command Line Interface)** is your best friend. It helps you scaffold, build, test, and deploy Angular projects with just a few commands. Instead of manually setting up configurations and boilerplate files, the CLI automates most of the repetitive work so you can focus on writing business logic and features.

In this article, weâ€™ll dive into everything you need to know about Angular CLI â€” from **installation and setup**, through **basic and advanced commands**, to **best practices** that will make your workflow smoother.

 

## ðŸš€ What is Angular CLI?

The **Angular CLI** is a powerful tool developed by the Angular team that simplifies the entire Angular development workflow. Think of it as a toolbox that provides ready-made solutions for tasks like:

- Creating and scaffolding Angular projects.
- Generating Angular components, services, pipes, and modules.
- Running a live development server with hot reloading.
- Building optimized production-ready bundles.
- Managing configurations for environments.
- Running unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- Updating Angular versions and dependencies.

Instead of manually creating files, adding imports, or configuring build tools, the CLI does it all in seconds.

 

## ðŸ›  Installing Angular CLI

Youâ€™ll need **Node.js** and **npm** installed before you can use Angular CLI. Once ready, install Angular CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
